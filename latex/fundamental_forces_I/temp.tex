If the universe is like a movie, then the elementary particles
that we discussed in the previous chapter are like the cast for
this movie.  But what if actors in a movie didn't interact at all
with each other or with anything else in the movie?  Imagine that
you went to see {\it Star Wars:  The Force Awakens}.
The movie started and you saw Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, 
Harrison Ford, Adam Driver and a cute, beach-ball-like android 
on the screen, but they didn't do anything.  They
didn't interact at all with each other.  They didn't talk with
each other.  They didn't fly cool spaceships from one planet to
another or engage in long fight scenes with conveniently-colored
light sabers.  Nothing at all happened -- they just sat there.   An
interesting movie it would not be.
